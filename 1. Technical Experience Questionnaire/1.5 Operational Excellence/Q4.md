# 1.5.4 How do you ensure AI-driven services are production-ready from an operational perspective (e.g., API versioning, service contracts, incident response, alerting, or defining SLOs/SLIs)?

---

-   Define strict versioned APIs and immutable service contracts.
-   Implement both automation testing and regression testing before deploying to production.
-   Document every service with measurable SLIs tied to SLOs.
-   Implement real-time alerts to either email or other applications on error rates, latency, drift, and runtime anomalies.
-   Monitoring behaviour, performance, and contract stability across deployments.
