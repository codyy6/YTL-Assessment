# 1.5.2 What approaches would you use to ensure fault tolerance and resilience in AI driven services (e.g., timeouts, retries, fallbacks)?

---

## Redundancy

Deploy multiple instances of the AI model and service across different servers or availability zones to handle failures gracefully.

## Load Balancing

Distribute incoming requests across multiple healthy instances so that a single overloaded or failed server doesn't cause downtime.

## Failover

Automatically reroute traffic to a backup instance or system when the primary one fails.
