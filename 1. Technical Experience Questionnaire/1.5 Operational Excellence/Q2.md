# 1.5.2 What approaches would you use to ensure fault tolerance and resilience in AI driven services (e.g., timeouts, retries, fallbacks)?

---

My hands-on experience with these patterns is primarily from frontend development using React Query (timeouts, retries, suspense), but I understand how these principles apply to AI service resilience:

## Timeouts

Set maximum wait times for model inference (e.g., 10s for LLM responses) to prevent hanging requests. If timeout is exceeded, return an error message or fallback response rather than leaving users waiting.

## Retries with Backoff

Implement retry logic for network failures. Will not retry on validation errors or 4xx responses, only on 5xx errors or network failures. Will limit the number of retried too (usually between 3 - 5)

## Fallback Strategies

-   **Cached responses**: Serve previously successful responses for similar queries
-   **Degraded functionality**: Return simpler responses or pre-computed results instead of failing completely
-   **Model fallback**: If primary model times out or fails, fall back to a faster, simpler model

## Infrastructure Resilience

-   **Redundancy**: Deploy multiple instances across availability zones
-   **Load balancing**: Distribute requests across healthy instances, automatically removing unhealthy ones from rotation
-   **Health checks**: Regular endpoint monitoring to detect failures before users are impacted
