# 1.4.2 Share a situation where you had to balance accuracy, latency, and cost when building an AI feature. What trade-offs did you make?

---

In a situation like this, I will always look back at what is the main purpose of the AI feature. For different circumstances there will be different trade-offs to be made.

Using back my smart contract vulnerability detection as the example, usually the smart contract will be gone through an auditing process before the smart contract can be verified as vulnerability proof. The audit process can take up to weeks for the audit to be done.

In addition, as this is just a FYP, i do not worry about uptime or training time too much, as i have sufficient time during my estimation and i would just need to ensure the system is running well during my presentation.

With this in mind, I could sacrifice latency and cost for the benefit of accuracy.
