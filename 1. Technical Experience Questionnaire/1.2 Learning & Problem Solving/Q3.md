# 1.2.3 Mention a resource (framework, paper, principle, or tool) that has shaped your thinking in AI engineering and explain why.

---

There are actually 2 different research papers that reshaped my thinking in AI Engineering. The first is "Context Rotting" that is released by Chroma and the other is Apple's "Illusion of Thinking".

In Context Rotting, I learnt that expanding context windows without disciplined retrieval will create degradation in attention allocation and factual persistence. It keeps me reminded that I would need to prioritize controlled information flow and compression strategies.

As for Illusion of Thinking, it exposes how models do not have underlying reasoning competence, and its all is just an extreme level of data pattern matching. It drives a shift toward checking the internal reliability of the model instead of just rewarding polished but ungrounded outputs.
