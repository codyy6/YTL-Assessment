# 1.2.1 Describe an architectural or engineering concept that has influenced how you build AI systems.

---

One architectural concept that has significantly influenced how I build AI systems is modular hierarchical design/microservices. This approach prevents a complete system failure when an issue arises, makes it easier to identify the source of a problem, and allows updates to individual components without requiring changes to the entire system. Modules can be upgraded independently, scaled vertically or horizontally, and the data pipeline can be optimized for efficiency.

However, this approach requires careful consideration. If a small team is responsible for managing multiple services simultaneously, modular hierarchical design can become a liability, as the increased number of modules can make system maintenance more challenging in the absence of sufficient manpower.
