# 1.3.3 Have you worked with multimodal data (e.g., text, audio, images, video)? If yes, describe your approach. If not, how would you begin exploring such a domain systematically?

---

I have no exposure to multimodal data and this is my first time learning on how to approach this.

**Theoretical study**

- Study about the Topic
- Understand its use cases
- Learn about the framework, libraries, preprocessing, feature extraction methods

**Technical exploration**

- Define the domain to build
- Target tasks
- What are the accepted input, what should be the expected output
- Success criteria
- Isolate the modalities to handle
  - Text - utf-8, tokenization
  - Image - JPEG/PNG, RGB, HSV
  - Audio - WAV/16-bit/16kHz or 44.1kHz, mono vs stereo
  - Video - mp4, frame rate, resolution
- Map the standard/canonical representations for each modality
- Convert raw data to standardised format
- Map the standardised format to pass it into transformer

**Prototyping**

- Build a simple model that allow for testing and understanding
- Play around with the hyperparameters
- Formulate result
- Generate table that convert results into an interpretable format

**Understanding failures**

- Along the way, learn why some parts fail, why some models have bad results

**Refine pipeline**

- Based on the study and lesson, refine the whole pipeline to not just make a testable model, but build an actual model

**Reevaluate**

- Based on the refined model and pipeline, determine how is the model doing and decide on the next step
- Investigate what production considerations that needs to take place.
