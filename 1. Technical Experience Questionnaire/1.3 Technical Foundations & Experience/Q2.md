# 1.3.2 Share examples of the frameworks, libraries, or cloud services you've used for AI engineering (e.g., PyTorch, Hugging Face, LangChain, vector DBs, cloud ML services). What factors influenced your choice?

---

Currently I'm mostly working with Qwen LLM, Open AI, RabbitMQ, PostgreSQL, Redis, and potentially using Pinecone for the vector database. The factors that influence my choice are as below:

- Regulatory fit
- What is the expected load
- Concurrency
- What kind of data will we be storing (relational or non relational)
- Performance
- Latency
- Costs
- Ecosystem maturity
- Operational observability
