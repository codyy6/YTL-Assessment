# 1.3.1 Describe your experience deploying AI/ML systems into production. What scale (users, requests, or data) did they support?

---

To be direct: my production experience has been in traditional software CI/CD operations, not AI/ML systems specifically. In my previous role, I managed operational stability of CI/CD pipelines using TeamCity and Octopus, monitoring deployments for a system serving close to 1 million users. My responsibilities included real-time failure detection, rapid incident response, and executing fallback plans when issues couldn't be immediately resolved.

However, I recognize that ML systems introduce additional complexities beyond traditional software deployment:

-   **Model-specific concerns**: Model versioning, monitoring for data/concept drift, managing inference latency and throughput
-   **Deployment patterns**: A/B testing models in production, rollback strategies based on model performance degradation (not just system failures)
-   **Operational differences**: Retraining pipelines, feature store management, and the need to monitor both system health and model quality metrics

While my CI/CD experience provides a foundation for understanding deployment pipelines, reproducible builds, and environment promotion, I'm actively learning about ML-specific tooling and practices. I understand that deploying a model artifact requires different monitoring, testing, and rollback strategies compared to traditional application services.
