# 1.3.1 Describe your experience deploying AI/ML systems into production. What scale (users, requests, or data) did they support?

---

In my previous role, I was involved in the operational stability of CI/CD pipeline rather than contributing to model development. I needed to monitor TeamCity and Octopus deployments, ensuring that there are no failures in real time. If errors do happen, an immediate fix needs to be done quickly. If the issue cannot be resolved, then the fallback plan will be executed.

I am unable to disclose the actual number of users, but there are close to 1 million users for the entire system, but I have no idea of what the usual active users are at the same time for it. The system is mainly dealing with file data.

I believe this experience is similar to ML production needs, as model delivery depends on the same variants. Having reproducible builds, controlled promotion between environments, rollback on failure or performance degrade. I believe with the experience in the software CI/CD will help in ML deployments pipelines, even though the artifacts were application services rather than models.
