---

There are various reasons but here are some main reasons that drive me forward in AI engineering.

1. I'm fascinated to see how new innovation can change the world. Right now the self-driving cars, LLM, video generation, deepfakes or digital humans that I'm working on right now, it gets me excited to see how the world will change based on these innovations.

2. I have the dream of making a product that can have a positive impact on society, and with the evolution of AI right now, it keeps my drive up on understanding more on how it works and what other applications that can be done through it.

3. Based on the observation of myself, I like to tackle tough questions especially when it comes to logic questions. For me right now in the AI field, there are a lot of difficult topics that are not addressed yet, which I want to try tackling and solve if I have the fortunate opportunity to do so.

4. I enjoy tackling tough question. In the AI Engineer field, i would love to learn and solve issues like concept drift and optimizing token economics.
